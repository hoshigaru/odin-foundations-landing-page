# odin-foundations-landing-page

This is a project from the Odin Project. I'm nervous but excited to get this done!

Reflection:
It was really fun to use what I've learned over the last few days and slowly see the landing page take shape and come to life as I wrote more code. The example exercises were rewarding as well, but it's a different feeling when you write everything from scratch!
